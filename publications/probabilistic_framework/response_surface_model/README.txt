The main file to reproduce published results is the file named "run_1_case.py". When run,
it reproduces the Figure presented and discussed on the illustrative example.

The results requires the stitching procedure, as described in the ESI. Raw data for this
stitching is also provided in the "raw_data" folder. The folders "stitched_results", and
"unstitched_results" contains the main figures to analyze each result obtained to
ultimately form the results we show in the main text.

The rest of the scripts are concerned with supporting the main file "run_1_case.py" with
illustrations, individual functions, and stitching.
